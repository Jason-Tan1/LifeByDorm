## About The Project

**LifeByDorm** helps Canadian students find their ideal university dorm through authentic peer reviews and comprehensive listings. Students can search schools, compare dorms by ratings and reviews, and share their own experiences to help future residents make informed housing decisions.

Finding the right dorm can be overwhelming. LifeByDorm bridges the gap by providing real student reviews, detailed ratings across multiple categories (room quality, bathrooms, building, amenities, location), and a streamlined interface to explore housing options at universities across Canada.

## Key Features

- **University Search** – Quickly find any Canadian university and explore their residence options
- **Detailed Ratings** – Reviews cover room quality, bathrooms, building condition, amenities, and location
- **Student Reviews** – Read authentic experiences from students who lived in the dorms
- **Photo Uploads** – See real photos of dorm rooms uploaded by reviewers
- **University Profiles** – View university stats including founding year, student population, and acceptance rate
- **Dorm Listings** – Browse all available residences with descriptions, amenities, and room types
- **Admin Dashboard** – Moderation tools for managing reviews and content
